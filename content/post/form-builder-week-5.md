-----------------------------------------------
Welcome back to Week 5 of building a form builder! This week was all about fixing issues with yarn not hot reloading and selecting a new drag-and-drop library for our project. Letâ€™s dive in!

### Day 1 â€“ Fixing Yarn Not Hot Reloading in Dev and Prod

On the first day, I worked on fixing an issue with yarn not hot reloading in both development and production environments. I sat down with a senior developer to brainstorm solutions to the problem and ended up spending a total of 5 hours learning about vite.jsâ€™s configurations and exploring the react-form-builder2 library. I was able to fix the issue of my project not reloading with every change by configuring the frontend (including tsc checking) and the backend at the same time, so I can now run everything simultaneously with one command when in my development environment. This will save me loads of time when making code changes and overall make me more productive.

### Day 2 â€“ Project Planning and Updating Trello

I committed changes from the previous dayâ€™s coding session and updated the projectâ€™s Trello cards. I also did some project planning and brainstorming to ensure that I stayed on track with my projectâ€™s goals.

### Day 3 â€“ Fixing the Footer, Navbar, and the Homepage

I focused on fixing the footer and navbar to make them more responsive and visually appealing. I also removed unnecessary links from the navbar and fixed a whitespace issue on the homepage. I continued researching drag-and-drop libraries and decided to switch from react-form-builder2 to a new library due to its limitations.

### Day 4 â€“ Researching and Selecting a New Drag-and-Drop Library

I researched different drag-and-drop libraries, including react-dnd and dnd-kit. I compared and contrasted these libraries by reading their documentation and exploring their GitHub repositories. Ultimately, I decided to go with react-dnd due to its better code health and greater popularity. I started ripping out the react-form-builder2 library and replaced it with react-dnd. I followed along with a tutorial on YouTube to get started with react-dnd, but it didnâ€™t quite work as expected. I decided to re-read the react-dnd documentation and embrace the learning curve that comes with working with a new and complex library.

Thatâ€™s it for Week 5 of building a form builder. Join me next week as I continue to make progress and share updates. Thanks for reading.

P.S. The reason I havenâ€™t posted in a couple of weeks is that I caught a nasty cold and an ear infection, but Iâ€™m starting to get better! ðŸ™‚
