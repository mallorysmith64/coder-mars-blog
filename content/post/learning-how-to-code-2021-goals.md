-----------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------

I haveÂ 3 main goalsÂ for this year:

Learn data structures and algorithmns, some PHP, and hopefully land a developer positionÂ where I grow my skills and be of service. In order to achieve these goals, I can apply to jobs and consistently work on my coding skills throughout the year. Below I have outlined how I am going to achieve my learning goals. I used the S.M.A.R.T goal technique, so I could set realistic goals for this year.

1. Learn basic data structures and algorithmns

-----------------------------------------------

Specific

Learn basic data structures such as:

- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Arrays
- Hash Tables
- Binary Trees
- Tries
- Graphs

Measurable

- Measure progress based on # of leetcoce problems solved
- Should solve one problem for every day of the month
- Would like to solve at least 250 LeetCode problems this year

Attainable

- It's achievable if I focus on problems within or slightly above my current ability
- Don't get stuck too long on any particular problem
- Save and revisit problems that are too difficult for me now

Relevant

- As a developer, it's crucial to my career growth
- Unlocks super powers needed to solve challenging problems

Timely

Start date: January 1st, 2021

End date: December 31st, 2021

- Each week 7 problems are due

2.Learn PHPÂ and/or a Framework

-----------------------------------------------

Specific

A. Learn the basics such as:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Cookies
- Sessions
- File Processing
- Forms
- Sending Emails
- Basic Routing
- SQL Query Functions
- OOP concepts
- Error handling etc...

B. Build at least 1 portfolio worthy PHP project

Measurable

- Progress measured based on % completed in Codecademy's PHP courseÂ OR
- By crossing off topics or subtopics from the above list on a weekly basisÂ OR
- Committing PHP code almost daily to GitHub

Attainable

- Study for at least one pomodoro a day
- Focus on building one awesome PHP project
- Prioritize coding above my other activities and hobbies

Relevant

- Learning PHP will increase my prospects
- Will help me learn other languages and tools

Timely

Start date: January 1st, 2021

End date: December 31st, 2021

- Set aside 30 minutes a day to achieve my goal

And that's it!

By December 31st, we will see how effective or ineffective my strategy is for learning new coding skills in 2021. ðŸ™‚

Happy coding.
